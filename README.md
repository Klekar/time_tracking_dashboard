## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

- See loading skeletons as the page simulates loading by providing data 1-3 seconds after initial load _(My custom task)_.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I chose this project because I wanted to learn basics of `Styled Components` and this project seemed good for that case. Also promt to use `css grid` intrigued me as well since I havn't used it yet.

In `Styled Components` I learned (and a bit more):
  - Creating basic components and styling them to my needs.
  - Creating keyframes animation and using it.
  - Passing props to styled component and using props to change css.
  - Creating theme and using its values inside a styled component css.
  - Creating styled component with html attributes.
  - Making global style with Styled Components.

I obtained theoretical knowledge of `css grid` and all of its css attributes, with some practical application of it as well.

### Continued development

- I was actually thinking about creating whole time tracking app so if I ever decide to do one, I might use, at least partially, this dashboard.
- The relational selector :has() is not yet implemented in Firefox so I might implement a workaround for that but more likely it's a "continued developmnet" for Firefox devs :).

### Useful resources

- [Styled Components docs](https://styled-components.com/docs) - Since this was my first time working with Styled Components, this helped me a lot.
